# Ultimate Rankings

This was just a fun experiment to apply USA Ultimate's [ranking algorithm](http://play.usaultimate.org/teams/events/rankings/#algorithm) of ultimate frisbee teams to my local high school league.

Team results are submitted in a single file with the scores and teams in this format:

```
Score A
Team A Name
Score B
Team B Name
```

There are no blank lines between games. Example data files are included in the data folder.
